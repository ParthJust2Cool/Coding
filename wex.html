<summary style="color: black;"><b>How my landform was formed</b></summary>
<p style="color: #b40404"><b>The Cascade Mountains was formed near a convergent boundary where an oceanic plate(Juan De Fuca) and a continental plate(North American) are colliding and pushing together. The oceanic plate is subducting, and when it melts due to the high heat and pressure, it rises and erupts, creating the volcanic mountains.</b></p>

<p style="border: navy 5px dashed; margin: 10px"><b>The Cascade Mountain Range is a range that strectches from northern California to British Columbia(Canada), passing through Oregon and Washington.</b></p>
<p>Quick Joke: How do tectonic plates greet each other?</p>
<input type="text" id="jk"/><button onclick="checkJoke();">See if I'm right</button>
<p><b>Geologists study the Cascade Mountains because it gives them an opportunity to study processes such as the movement of tectonic plates, it gives them an opportunity to study stream dynamics(like the speed of the stream/water) and it gives them the opportunity to study the mineral deposits from many geologic ages.</b></p>
<p style="color: maroon"><b>About 90 million years ago, ocean rock drifted northward merging together.</b></p>
<p><b><u>Currently, at the Cascase mountains, there are landslides, and volcanic activity(Mt. St Helens, Mt. Baker, Mt. Rainier, Glacier Peak)</u></b></p>

<b>1.</b> <u>The Cascade Mountains are home to numerous waterfalls<br/>
<b>2.</b> <u>A highway named North Cascade Highway was built in 1972 was made acorss the Cascade Mountains<br/>
<b>3.</b> <u>There are about 300 glaciers in the Cascade range<br/>
<b>4.</b> <u>There is a lake in the Cascade Mountains called the Crater Lake, and it is the deepest lake in the U.S.<br/>
<b>5.</b> <u>There is more rainfall and snow on the western slopes of the Cascade mountains than the eastern slopes, creating a rain shadow effect that results in drier conditions on the east side.<br/>
