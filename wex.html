<summary style="color: blue;">How my landform was formed</summary>
<p style="color: orange">The Cascade Mountains was formed near a convergent boundary where an oceanic plate(Juan De Fuca) and a continental plate(North American) are colliding and pushing together. The oceanic plate is subducting, and when it melts due to the high heat and pressure, it rises and erupts, creating the volcanic mountains.</p>
